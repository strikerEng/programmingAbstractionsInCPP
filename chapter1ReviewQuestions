Chapter 1 Review Questions:
1. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?

Source file - contains the text of a user-defined program
Object file - contains machine language instructions which was translated by the compiler from the source file

2. What characters are used to mark comments in a C++ program?
// - single line comment
/* */ - multiline comment

3. In an #include line, the name of the library header file can be enclosed in either angle 
brackets of double quotation marks. What is the difference between the two forms of punctuation?
#include<libraryheaderfile.h> -  system library a part of standard C++
#include "libraryheaderfile.h" - user-defined libraries or come from other libraries

4. How would you define a constant called CENTIMETERS_PER_INCH with the value 2.54?
const double CENTIMETERS_PER_INCH = 2.54;

5. What is the name of the function that must be defined in every C++ program?
main()

6. What is the purpose of inserting endl into the output stream cout?
end of line segment so the next text stream sent to the console output starts on a new line

7. What four properties are established when you declare a variable?
name, type, scope, and value
name - reference to some space in memory
type - the data type of a value
scope - the life of a variable, global or local
value - the value associated with a name, or variable

8. Indicate which of the following are legal variable names in C++:
    a.x YES
    b. formula1 YES
    c. average_rainfall YES
    d. %correct NO, uses special characters
    e. short NO, reserved
    f. tiny YES
    g. total output NO, has spaces
    h. aReasonablyLongVariableName YES
    i. 12MonthTotal NO, starts with a number
    j. marginal-cost NO, has special characters
    k. b4hand YES
    l. _stk_depth YES

9. What are the two attributes that define a data type?
domain - set of values that belong to the data type
set of operations - behaviors of the data type

10. What is the difference between the types short, int, and long?
The size of their domain.
The size of the integer cannot decrease as you move from short to int to long. (see pg.20)

11. What does ASCII stand for?
American Standard Code for Information Interchange

12. List all possible values of type bool.
true false

13. What statements would you include in a program to read a value from the user and store it in the variable x, which is declared as a double?
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    /* variable declaration */
    double x;
    /* get user input */
    std::cin >> x;

    /* display user input */
    std::cout << "x: " << x << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

14. Suppose that a function contains the following declarations:
    int i;
    double d;
    char c;
    string s;
Write a statement that displays the values of each of these variables on the screen.
#include <iostream>
cout << "i: " << i << "d: " << d << "c: " << c << "s: " << s << endl;

15. Indicate the values and types of the following expressions:
    a. 2 + 3 -> int 5
    b. 19 / 5 -> int 3
    c. 19.0 / 5 -> double 3.8
    d. 3 * 6.0 -> int 18
    e. 19 % 5 -> int 4
    f. 2% 7 -> int 2

16. What is the difference between the unary minus and the binary subtraction operator?
unary minus takes one operand
binary subtraction operand takes two operands

What is a type cast and how do you indicate on in C++?
Type cast changes the data type of a value.

int x = 0;
double(x);

17. What does the term truncation mean?
Discarding a decimal fraction

18. Calculate the result of each of the following expressions:
    a. 6+5/4- 3
    b. 2 + 2 * (2 * 2 - 2) % 2 / 2
    c. 10 + 9 * ((8 + 7) % 6) + 5 * 4 % 3 * 2 + 1
    d. 1 + 2 + (3 + 4) * ((5 * 6 % 7 * 8) - 9) - 10
19. How do you specify a shorthand assignment operation?
int x = 0;
x += 10; 

20. What is the difference between the expressions ++x and x++?
++x - prefix increment, the value of x is incremented then used in the surrounding expression
x++ - suffix increment, the value of x before incrementing is used in the surrounding expression

21. What does the term short-circuit evaluation mean?
When the truth value of a booolean operator does not need to evaluate all of it subexpressions 

22. Write out the general syntactic form for each of the following control statements:if, switch, while, for.
if (condition) statement
if (condition) statement else statement

switch (e){
    case(c1) { statement … statement break;}
    default {statement … statement break;}
}

while (conditional expression ){ statements}

23. Describe in English the general operation of the switch statement.
Given a value, which case does this value match, then executue a set of statements for this specific case
The break statement moves the program execution to the next statement directly after the switch statement. In C++, without the break statement, the program 
will execute the following cases as well.

24. What is a sentinel?
A value that signals the end of receiving input

25. What for loop control line would you use in each of the following situations?

a. Counting from 1 to 100
for (int i = 1; i <= 100: i++){}

b. Counting by sevens starting at 0 until the number has more than two digits
for (int i = 0; i <= 99; i = i + 7){}

c. Counting backward by twos from 100 to 0
for (int i = 100; i >= 0: i = i - 2)

26. What is a function prototype?
Defines a function and its parameters excluding only its implementation 

27. In your own words, describe what happens when you call a function in C++.
The name refers to a block of code, then the statements and expressions are executed inside of that function
